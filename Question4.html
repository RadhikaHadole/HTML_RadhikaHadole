	 <font face="Onyx">The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. </font><br>
	 <font face="Ravie">The ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface. As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface.</font><br>
